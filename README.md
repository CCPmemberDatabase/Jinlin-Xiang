Final-year Ph.D. candidate in Electrical & Computer Engineering at the University of Washington, advised by Prof. Eli Shlizerman. My research interests lie broadly in computer vision and machine learning, with a focus on developing knowledge transfer algorithms that enable lightweight AI models to achieve performance comparable to large models. I have over two years of industry experience in healthcare AI, with hands-on work involving audio, video, clinical trial text, multimodal data, and real-world applications of large language models. Expected graduation: March 2026.
